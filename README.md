This repository contains my hands-on projects, mini-experiments, and notes as I learn computer vision using Python. The work here is based on a mix of courses, tutorials, and personal experiments.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals

- Learn computer vision fundamentals using Python, OpenCV, and Deep Learning.
- Practice implementing real-world image and video processing tasks.
- Build a portfolio of projects that show practical understanding.
- Explore topics such as object detection, segmentation, face recognition, and more.

## ðŸ“š Learning Sources

The projects in this repository are based on (and inspired by) content from the following sources:

- ðŸ“˜ [Udemy - Python for Computer Vision with OpenCV and Deep Learning](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-computer-vision-with-opencv-and-deep-learning/)
- ðŸŽ¥ [YouTube Channels]
- ðŸ“„ Official documentations and tutorials

I credit all original sources where applicable and aim to **expand and personalize** each exercise to deepen understanding.
